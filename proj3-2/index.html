		  <p>
			In this project, I have implemented an extension to the pathtracer project that renders
			glass/mirror materials (Part 1) and microfacet materials (Part 2). More specific overviews of each part
			are provided under each section.

        <h2 align="middle">Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>
		<h3><b>
            **Overview
        </b></h3>
		<p>
			In this part, I have implemented the rendering of the mirror and glass materials. To generate mirror surfaces (shown on the left sphere),
			I first wrote the code for reflection of w_o about the surface normal. Then, using spherical equations and Snell's law, I've calculated the 
			refracted ray direction, making sure to update `eta` based on the direction of wo and check if the total internal reflection occurs.
			<br>
			Then, to render the glass sphere (shown on the right), I have used Schlick's approximation to calculate the Fresnel term, using the 
			preudocode from the specs.

		</p>

		<li>m = 3: here, both left and right spheres are visible and display their materials more or less accurately. The right sphere started to refract the light from the light source onto the floor. The left sphere, however, still shows the reflection of the right sphere from the past. </li><br>
		<li>m = 4: here, as we have more rays bouncing off the surfaces, the entire room is more lit up. Also, the left sphere shows the updated reflection of the right sphere. The right sphere refracts more light onto the floor, and we now can see a spot of light on the wall.</li><br>
		<li>m = 5: here, not much difference between this image and the previous one, except that the entire image is more bright, and there is more white noise all around.</li><br>
		<li>m = 100: despite a huge jump in the maximum ray depth allowed, this image is not much different from m = 5 setting. This image is just more bright.</li>

        <h2 align="middle">Part 2. Microfacet Material</h1>
		<h3><b>
			**Overview
		</b></h3>
		<p>
			In this part, I have implemented the renders of the microfacet materials, which allowed me to generate images of bunnies and dragons 
			with different roughness coefficients and different conductor surface materials. In order to do that, I first computed the Normal Distribution Function (NDF) that 
			adopts Beckmann distribution. Then, I computed the Fresnel term using approximations from the specs. For each material, I had to find specific
			values for eta and k corresponding to three fixed wavelenghts (614 nm, 549 nm, and 466 nm). After getting F, G, and D terms, I have implemented
			the Microfacet BRDF function. Finally, in order for the images to look more realistic, I had to replace the cosine hemisphere sampling
			(that works only for diffuse materials) to the importance sampling.

Note that, to change the $\alpha$, just open the .dae file and search for `microfacet`.

        <p>
            The parameter $\alpha$ controls the roughness of the surface. 
			The smaller the value, the smoother the surface, which we can see on the first image ($\alpha$ = 0.005). 
			There, the material is also much glossier/specular, which causes more noise appears on the render.
			On the contrary, rough surfaces ($\alpha$ = 0.5) generate almost noise-free images.

        <p>
            Here, we can see that the bunny rendered with importance sampling has a more realistic appearance. The cosine hemisphere
			provides uniform sampling, so it works well for diffuse surfaces, but it does not work well for surfaces of the conductor materials.
			The importance sampling is less noisy because it samples the areas of the surface that are more likely to have an impact on the image appearance.
